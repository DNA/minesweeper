# Simple Minesweeper

This is a simple Minesweeper game built in ruby that runs directly from the command-line.

## Starting the game

Just clone this repository, give execution permission to `play.rb` and you are ready to go :)

## small disclaimer:

This is just a proof of concept meant as a test for a job interview. The interface is minimal as it was requested in the code description, so if something fail silently, you know the reason ;)

I may or may not keep tinkering with this code, but all suggestions are welcome!
